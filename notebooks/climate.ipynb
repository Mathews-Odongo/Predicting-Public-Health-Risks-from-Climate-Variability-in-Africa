    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "Climate change is intensifying health risks across Africa, affecting diseases like malaria, cholera, and respiratory infections. Understanding how climatic and environmental conditions influence disease outbreaks is crucial for guiding public health interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Public health agencies in Africa need a data-driven way to predict when and where disease risks will rise due to changing climate conditions (temperature, humidity, air quality, rainfall). Early prediction enables timely response, resource allocation, and prevention planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Question\n",
    "Can we predict disease risk levels using climate and environmental indicators?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "To build a machine learning model that predicts the Vector-Borne Disease Risk Score (or another health metric like `respiratory_disease_rate`) based on climate and environmental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specific Goals\n",
    "- Explore relationships between climate variables and disease indicators.  \n",
    "- Identify the most influential climatic factors driving disease outbreaks.  \n",
    "- Build and evaluate ML models that predict disease risk with high accuracy.  \n",
    "- Provide actionable insights for climate-health policy and planning.\n"
